DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND RESULT INTERPRETATION
4.1	Introduction
This chapter focuses on analyzing, presenting, and interpreting the data from the comparative analysis of the impact of variations in petroleum prices on food prices in Nigeria using index number analysis (1999 – 2020).

Table 4.1: Data presentation
4.2	Result and Discussion
The results of the Multiple linear Regression, Normality test, P-P plot, and ANOVA are as follows
4.2.1	Normality test 
A normality test is a test carried out on the data satisfying the assumption that data must be normally distributed
 
Figure 1: Normality Assumption Test Graph of the Consumer price index
Figure 1 shows a normal curve which implies that the data used for this project follows a normal distribution satisfying the normality assumption.
4.2.2	P-P Plot
This is a Probability plot for assessing how closely two or more datasets agree. 
 
Figure 2: P-P Plot
The P-P Plot shows a close dispersion of the residuals around the mean which also confirms the Normality of the data.

4.2.3	Scatter diagram
A scatter diagram is used to compare the variables against each other to see if there is a relationship.
 
Figure 3: A scatter plot of the petroleum pump price
 A scatter plot shows that there is a positive linear relationship between the Consumer price index, petroleum price, and the Average Consumer price index of Nigeria. This show a strong positive relationship between the variables.
4.2.4 The Multiple Regression Analysis
Multiple regression analysis is performed when evaluating the association between three or more variables.

Table 4.2: Test for the Model of the Regression Model
Table 4.2 tests the effect of the Multiple linear regression model on our response variable (i.e. Petroleum pump price) to know whether it is valid and reliable to be used for predicting petroleum pump prices in the future. The coefficient of determination R-square = 0.696 indicates that the linear regression model accounts for 69.6% of the total variation in our data and thus, implies that the model is a very good prediction model. Moreover, the p-value = 0.000 also implies that the model is statistically significant with a p-value less than the alpha-value of 0.05. However, the parameters of this model can be used to forecast the future occurrence of CPI if they are found to be statistically significant on the CPI.

Table 4.3: Multiple Regression Analysis
Table 4.3 shows the two cases of Consumer Price Index(CPI) which are the Petroleum pump prices and the average Consumer Price Index have p-values of 0.000 and 0.51 respectively which shows that the Petroleum pump prices has a significant impact on the Petroleum pump prices with p-value(0.000) < 0.05 while the average Consumer Price Index is insignificant with p-value(0.51) > 0.05. This implies that only the Petroleum pump prices has an impact on Consumer price index of Nigeria. 
The Multiple linear fitted regression line for the future occurrence of Consumer price index is given as follows:
Consumer price index = -29.711 + 1.509*Petroleum pump price + 1.865*ACPI                   4.1
Where -29.711 is the constant value or intercept of the line, 1.509 and 1.865 are coefficients also known as the regression parameters. CPI is the consumer price index and ACPI is the average consumer price index. Therefore, Equation 4.1 can be used to obtain likely future rate of the Consumer price index. This implies that for  unit increase in Petroleum pump price, there will be a corresponding increase in the Consumer price index of Nigeria by 1.509 while the intercept and other parameter are kept constant.
4.3 ANOVA
This is a statistical analysis tool that divides the observed aggregate variability within a data collection.
ANOVA
Model	Sum of Squares	DF	Mean Square	F	Sig.
1	Regression	95700.203	2	47850.102	21.771	.000
	Residual	41759.221	19	2197.854		
	Total	137459.425	21			

Table 4.4: ANOVA Table
Table 4.4 shows that our independent variables petroleum Pump prices and Average Consumer price index has collectively a significant impact on  Consumer price index of Nigeria since the p-value(0.000) is less than our α-value(0.05). 
4.2.6 Interpretation
Hypothesis 1:
H0: There is a significant impact of the Consumer Price Index on the Petroleum pump prices
H1: There is no significant impact of the Consumer Price Index on the Petroleum pump prices
Hypothesis 2:
H0: There is a significant impact of the Petroleum pump prices on the Average Consumer Price Index
H1: There is no significant impact of the Petroleum pump prices on the Average Consumer Price Index

The dependent variable Consumer Price Index was regressed on predicting variables Petroleum Pump Prices and average Consumer Price Index to test the hypotheses H0 and H1 respectively. Petroleum Pump Prices significantly predicted the Consumer price index, F(2,44) = 21.771, with p-value = 0.000 < 0.05 which implies that the Petroleum Pump Prices can play a significant role in Consumer Price index. On the other hand, the average consumer price index predicted Consumer Price index with a p-value (0.635) > 0.05 which implies that the average consumer price index cannot play a significant role in the Consumer Price index of Nigeria.
4.2.7 Discussion
The analysis of the relationship between the Consumer Price index, Petroleum Pump Prices, and the Average Consumer price index shows several interesting results first of which is the test of normality which was carried out using the normality test graph, p-p plot, and scatter diagram and also satisfies the assumption. Our analysis also shows that the two cases of Consumer Price index which are the Petroleum Pump Prices and the Average Consumer price index have a p-value of 0.000 and 0.635 respectively which implies that the Petroleum Pump Prices has a significant impact on the Consumer Price index of Nigeria with p-value < 0.05 while the other independent variable is not. The ANOVA table shows that our explained variables Petroleum Pump Prices and the average Consumer Price Index have collectively a significant impact on the Consumer Price index of Nigeria since the p-value (0.000) is less than our alpha-value (0.05).
